# Mini Piano using Tinkercad

This project implements a simple mini piano using Tinkercad, an online platform for designing and simulating electronic circuits. The mini piano is designed to play different musical notes when virtual buttons are pressed on the Tinkercad simulation.

## Overview

The mini piano project consists of the following components:
- Arduino UNO: The microcontroller that processes the button inputs and controls the virtual piano.
- Pushbuttons: Virtual buttons in Tinkercad representing piano keys.
- Piezo Buzzer: Used to generate musical tones corresponding to the pressed buttons.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Tinkercad project:
   - Visit the Tinkercad website: [https://www.tinkercad.com/](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
   - Open the mini piano project by [https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4a1HQpVaJS8-mini-piano].
2. Simulate the Mini Piano:
   - Press the virtual buttons to simulate playing the piano keys.
   - Observe the corresponding musical tones generated by the piezo buzzer.

## Simulation Controls
- Press the virtual buttons to play individual musical notes.
- Explore different combinations of buttons to play melodies.
- Adjust the tempo and rhythm of your tunes.


## Dependencies
- Arduino IDE: If you want to modify the Arduino code, you can use the Arduino IDE to upload it to a physical Arduino board.
